			<h3>Love</h3>
			<p>Everything we do is <strong>imbued with love</strong> - love for our clients, love for each other, love for our work, and love for oneself.</p>
		</div>
		<div class='six columns'>
			<h3>Freedom of Spirit</h3>
			<p>The individual characteristics of each team member contributes to the larger success of our company. We’re going to be <strong>ourselves</strong> - and we strive to be <strong>better</strong>. We allow our creativity to flow into all of our work. And we only choose the work that gets us excited.</p>
		</div>
		<div class='six columns'>
			<h3>Quality</h3>
			<p>The quality of our work <strong>separates us from our competitors</strong>. Pride in our work naturally flows from delivering a best-in-class product. We believe in rigorous research, planning, testing and flexibility with changing requirements - and dissatisfaction until completion.</p>
		</div>
		<div class='six columns'>
			<h3>Honesty</h3>
			<p>Always constructive. We value honesty, not brutality. Irrelevant of hierarchy - from intern to CEO. Timely - not <strong>after</strong> disaster but <strong>before</strong>. Rooted in fact, with no fear. We accept responsibility - when it’s ours to accept. Finally, and most importantly: always centered in love.</p>
		</div>
		<div class='six columns'>
			<h3>Team First</h3>
			<p>Our accomplishments are not achieved by individuals alone, but rather by <strong>proactive people working together</strong>. We value steady communication and trust each other - and fight to earn that trust. Groupthink unwelcome.</p>
		</div>
		<div class='six columns'>
			<h3>Responsibility</h3>
			<p>We depend on our teams to get things done on time and at a high professional standard. <strong>We</strong> are responsible for the quality of your work. <strong>We</strong> are responsible for our team’s performance. We <strong>own</strong> the project - it reflects us.</p>
