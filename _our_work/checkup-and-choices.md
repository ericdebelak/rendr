CheckUp & Choices is a free survey screener designed to give users feedback on their alcohol consumption habits. Featured on NPR, The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, and Men's Health Magazine, CheckUp & Choices offers an objective, non-judgmental screening course that allows you to consider what, if anything, you may want to change about your drinking. It offers resources and tools on how to cut back or stop drinking altogether based on your feedback, and can reduce the chance of relapse.

**Analysis**

Rendr has worked with CheckUp & Choices as their primary technology partner to develop and maintain this application. Rendr stepped in and created a more mature application including greater core functionality and additional features.  

**Development**

CheckUp & Choices was built in React.js with Redux on the front-end, Python with Flask on the backend / API, and using a MongoDB database. Rendr has bettered the user experience and functionality of the app from both a user and admin perspective, adding reporting features, improved data visualization, and partner implementations.
