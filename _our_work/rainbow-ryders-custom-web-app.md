Rainbow Ryders is the largest private hot air balloon ride company in the United States. As they’ve expanded, the balloon ride company found that average booking and operations software didn’t meet their custom needs. Rainbow Ryders contacted Rendr to build a custom solution to streamline their booking, business operations and ecommerce.

### Analysis

Rendr has worked with Rainbow Ryders as their primary tech team as we build the custom application. We have streamlined their booking and ecommerce process into an easy-to-use app, and continue to add features to the software.

### Development

Rainbow Ryders was built in React.js with Redux on the front-end, a Lumen PHP backend API and a mySQL database. The API is also used to integrate with booking functionality through their WordPress site.

### Key Features

#### Booking

Customers can make reservations through the app and customer service representatives are able to make, manage and edit the reservations. The application software allows the customers to input date, ride and location, as well as choosing from coupons, addons, gift cards, agencies.

#### Operations

The application software allows Rainbow Ryders to manage rides, employees, balloons and passengers. It schedules them and allows representatives to print out reports for the crew and pilots.

#### Reporting

The software compiles sophisticated reports for all aspects of the business with multiple filter options on each report.

#### eCommerce

Rainbow Ryders can sell merch and gift cards, and can manage inventory through the app.
